.TH JETTISON 1
.SH NAME
jettison \- launch program into a predefined chroot environment with a new
mount namespace, pid namespace, and optional net namespace.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI jettison
.RI [ program_path ] \  [ pod_config ] \  [ options ] \ [program_arguments... ]
.P
.I program_path
is the absolute path to program,
.I pod_config
file defines the new environment, and
.I options
are described below.
.I program_arguments
start at the first unrecognized option and get passed to program on exec.

.B e.g:
.RS
jettison /bin/bash ~/podconfigs/bash1.pod
.P
jettison /bin/bash ~/podconfigs/bash2.pod --lognet 0 0 --strict
.RE

.\"JETTISON OPTIONS
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
--procname, -p
Set name of process
.TP
--strict
Seccomp kills process
.TP
--tracecalls
Count each system call made and generate an optimized seccomp whitelist.
.TP
--lognet <size> <count>
Generate logs of newnet ip/macvlan traffic using seperately sandboxed tcpdump
program. Both arguments must be supplied. Log files are stored in a uniquely
named directory at current working directory.
.I size
is unrestricted if 0, otherwise this is file_size limit passed to tcpdump (in
millions of bytes, not megabytes). If
.I count
is 0 the log file is indefinitely incremented when it reaches
.I size
bytes. If
.I count
is 2 or greater tcpdump will rotate between that many log files.

.TP
--logoutput
Write stdout and stderr to time stamped log file at current working directory.
.TP
--daemon
Disconnects controlling terminal and orphans process.
.TP
--block-new-filters
Seccomp optimization.
.TP
--blacklist
Replace seccomp rules with the system-wide blacklist.
.TP
--allow-ptrace
Usually ptrace is disabled unless this option is specified, or using
--blacklist and __NR_ptrace is missing from blacklist file.
.TP
--stacksize
Set stacksize of new cloned thread in kilobytes.

.SH DESCRIPTION

Launches program into a chroot environment. Typically located somewhere like
e.g: /opt/pods/user/config.pod/ using current username and pod filename, this
new root contains the files and directories specified in pod config. A pod's
/podhome can be accessed by owner for copying files in and out. Pods are
otherwise root owned and can usually be destroyed using
.BR jettison_destruct (1).

.B Seccomp:
Seccomp filter is specified in the pod config file unless --blacklist is used,
in which case the pod seccomp options are completely replaced by
.IR /etc/jettison/blacklist .

.B Capabilities:
File capabilities can be allowed with the trade-off of NO_NEW_PRIVS not being
set, and the capabilities requested will be left in bounding set. This feature
is optional and can be disabled, see the customization section.

.\" POD CONFIG FILE
.SH POD CONFIG OPTIONS

.\" file
.TP
.B file
.RB [ r | w | x | d | s ]
</file/path>: Bind mount file into pod with the specified
remount options. Granting file capability is the only use of
.BR s uid
flag.
.RB ( r )ead,\ ( w )rite,\ e( x )ecute,\ ( d )evice,\ ( s )uid.

.\" home
.TP
.B home
.RB [ r | w | x | d | s ]
</home/file>: Like the file option, but works relative to home directory instead
of system root. e.g: 'home r /.bashrc'.


.\" seccomp
.TP
.BR seccomp_allow \ <__NR_syscall>
Add systemcall to seccomp whitelist. If nothing is added to list
every system call is allowed, except ptrace.

.TP
.BR seccomp_block \ <__NR_syscall>
Failed seccomp check returns with errno, useful to prevent --strict killings.

.\" newnet
.TP
.B newnet
.RS
.TP
.I none
Create a blank new net namespace.
.TP
.I loop
New net namespace with loopback set up.
.TP
.IR ipvlan \ < device > \  < ipaddr >
Create ipvlan interface with same gateway and mac address as
.IR device ,
and new static ip address.
.TP
.IR maclan \ < device > \  < macaddr > \  < ipaddr >
Create macvlan interface with same gateway as
.IR device ,
a new mac address, and new static ip address. You can specify
**:**:**:**:**:** to use default mac assigned by the kernel.
.RE

.\" newpts
.TP
.B newpts
Mount a new pts instance in pod.

.\" noproc
.TP
.B noproc
Do not mount /proc filesystem.

.\" home_exec
.TP
.B home_exec
Remount /podhome directory with execute flag.

.\" capability
.TP
.BR capability \ <CAP_NAME>
Allow process to elevate privilege through files with
.RB ( s )uid
flag set, if that capability is not internally blacklisted by jettison.

.\" X11
.TP
.B X11
This does not sandbox X11 in any profound way other than it's intended purpose
of filtering auth data/socket so pod can only access the current $SCREEN. This
works assuming system only provides X11 socket through /tmp. So something like
`startx -- -nolisten local -nolisten tcp` would be the best way to protect your
X11 sessions.

.\" NOTES
.SH NOTES
User's pod config directories are not tracked, and is generated using the
config file name. It's best practice to always use unique pod config names.
.P
It can take a few minutes before a macvlan address will become
available for use again after process exits.
.P
Ipvlan requires ipv6 kernel.


.SH BUGS
If using --daemon with --logoutput, LD_PRELOAD is used to set stdio to line
buffered mode since it is piped and not a regular log file. If the daemon
uses file capabilites this will not be allowed for security reasons, so you
may have to patch these daemons yourself to write in line buffered mode or
there will be log data loss.

.SH CUSTOMIZATION
There are a bunch of defines for changing paths and various other parameters
see src/defines.h and makefile for more details.
